## Introduction

Billo Invoicing helps freelancers and small businesses create professional invoices, get paid on time, and keep on top of their finances. Over the past month we've shipped several improvements that make Billo Invoicing faster to set up, easier to use, and more insightful for your day‑to‑day decisions.

We build Billo Invoicing in partnership with our community. Your feedback: What saves you time, where things feel clunky and what would help you grow, directly shapes our roadmap. This month's updates focus on simplifying payment setup, improving visibility into your business, and refining everyday workflows.

## Stripe Connect Integration: One‑Click Payment Setup

Accepting payments should be simple. We've introduced Stripe Connect with an OAuth flow so you can connect Stripe to Billo Invoicing in seconds - no API keys, no copy‑and‑paste, no guesswork.

- One‑click connection via Stripe Connect OAuth
- No manual API key entry required
- Faster onboarding and fewer configuration steps
- Seamless payment link creation embedded in your invoice previews and PDFs
- Secure token storage with encryption for peace of mind
- Backward compatibility for teams already using manual API keys

With Stripe Connect, setup is quicker and more secure. Once connected, Billo Invoicing automatically generates payment links for your invoices, helping clients pay you faster with cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. If you previously added a Stripe API key, don't worry - your setup continues to work, and you can switch to Connect whenever you're ready.

## Enhanced Dashboard Analytics

We've upgraded our analytics to give you clearer, more actionable insights at a glance. These changes are designed to help freelancers and small teams understand cash flow, track performance, and make informed decisions without getting lost in spreadsheets.

- Clear breakdowns of issued, sent, viewed, and paid invoices
- Trends that surface month‑on‑month changes and seasonality
- Highlighted metrics that matter most to solo operators and small teams
- Faster loading and improved responsiveness across devices

Whether you're tracking overdue invoices, planning ahead, or reviewing performance, the dashboard now makes it easier to see what's working, what needs attention, and what to do next.

## User Experience Improvements

Little refinements add up. We've tweaked several parts of the product to reduce friction and help you move faster.

- Smoother invoice creation workflow with clearer defaults and fewer clicks
- Consistent date formatting across invoice tables (Issued, Due, Sent, Viewed, Paid) using your timezone
- Polished copy and clearer labels throughout the app
- Improved brand clarity: consistent "Billo Invoicing" naming in page titles and the Apple web app title

These enhancements are about saving you minutes on routine tasks and making Billo Invoicing feel more predictable and professional day to day.

## Technical Highlights

We keep the technical details light, but a few improvements are worth calling out because they directly improve security and reliability.

- Encrypted token storage for connected accounts (e.g. Stripe Connect)
- Stronger CSRF protections across sensitive actions
- Infrastructure improvements to support faster analytics and more reliable payment workflows
- Ongoing performance optimisations and more robust error handling

The short version: things are faster, safer, and more resilient behind the scenes.

## What This Means for You

- Connect Stripe in seconds instead of copying and pasting API keys
- More reliable, secure payment processing with automatic payment links
- Better visibility into your business performance with clearer analytics
- Simpler workflows that save time on every invoice

If you're new to Billo Invoicing, the setup is now easier than ever. If you're already using Billo Invoicing, you'll notice smoother flows and clearer information wherever you work.

## Get Started

Ready to try the new features?

If you're using manual API keys today, you can continue as normal or switch to the one‑click connection whenever it suits you.

## Closing

At Billo Invoicing, we're committed to user‑focused development: updates that reduce friction, improve clarity, and help you get paid. We'll keep rolling out improvements that reflect your feedback and the realities of running a modern freelance or small business.

Over the past few months, we've been hard at work shaping Billo into a modern, secure and above all, easy to use platform for creating invoices.
This post highlights the key milestones in our development cycle so far - from the foundation of our core features to the refinements that make Billo easier and smarter to use every day.

- User-first design with a clean, responsive interface
- Security-first approach with encryption and compliance at the core
- Create invoices in seconds

## Date Range Quantity Calculation

### What's New

We've introduced a game-changing feature that automatically calculates line item quantities based on date ranges. Perfect for time-based billing, this feature eliminates manual calculations and reduces errors.

### How It Works

1. **Enable the Feature**: Toggle "Date Range Quantity Calculation" in the Invoice Actions panel
2. **Set Date Ranges**: For any line item, you can now:
   - Select a start date and end date
   - Choose your calculation metric: days, weeks, or hours
   - Watch as the quantity automatically updates

### Example Use Cases

- **Project-based billing**: "Development work from Jan 17 - Jan 20" automatically calculates to 3 days
- **Hourly services**: Set start and end times to calculate exact hours worked
- **Weekly retainers**: Automatically calculate the number of weeks in a billing period

### Smart Calculation

The system intelligently calculates quantities:

- **Days**: Calculates the difference between start and end dates (e.g., Jan 17 to Jan 20 = 3 days)
- **Weeks**: Converts days to weeks (rounded up)
- **Hours**: Calculates exact hours between start and end times

### Flexible Usage

- **Per-line flexibility**: Each line item can independently use date ranges or manual quantity entry
- **Mixed invoices**: Combine date-based and manual quantity items in the same invoice
- **Visual clarity**: Date ranges are displayed below item descriptions in both web and PDF views

### Available Everywhere

This feature works seamlessly across:

- ✅ Invoices
- ✅ Quotes
- ✅ All invoice templates
- ✅ PDF exports
- ✅ Web previews

## Enhanced Discount Management

### Simplified Workflow

We've streamlined discount management to make your invoicing process cleaner and more intuitive.

### Key Improvements

1. **"None" Option**: The discount dropdown now includes a "None" option, selected by default
2. **Cleaner Interface**: When "None" is selected, discount input fields are automatically hidden
3. **Less Clutter**: Your invoice form stays tidy when discounts aren't needed

### How to Use

- **No discounts needed?** Leave it set to "None" - discount fields stay hidden
- **Need discounts?** Simply select "Percentage" or "Fixed Value" and the discount inputs appear
- **Switch anytime**: Change discount types on the fly without losing your work

## Improved Invoice Actions

### Better Organisation

We've reorganised the Invoice Actions panel to group related features together:

- **Date Range Toggle**: Now conveniently located in Invoice Actions with helpful tooltips
- **CIS Management**: Construction Industry Scheme settings moved to Invoice Actions for better visibility
- **Help Icons**: Quick access to explanations for complex features

### Enhanced User Experience

- **Contextual help**: Click the help icon next to any feature to learn more
- **Logical grouping**: Related features are now grouped together
- **Cleaner layout**: More intuitive organisation reduces confusion

## PDF Enhancements

### Complete Feature Parity

All new features are fully supported in PDF exports:

- **Date ranges displayed**: Date range information appears below item descriptions in PDFs
- **Consistent formatting**: Date ranges formatted consistently across all PDF templates
- **Professional appearance**: Maintains clean, professional invoice layouts

## Getting Started

### For Date Range Quantity Calculation

1. Create a new invoice or quote
2. In the Invoice Actions panel (right side), toggle "Date Range Quantity Calculation"
3. Add or edit a line item
4. Enable date range for that item
5. Select your start date, end date, and metric
6. Watch the quantity calculate automatically!

### For Discount Management

1. In Payment Details, select your discount type from the dropdown
2. Choose "None" to hide discount fields, or select "Percentage" or "Fixed Value" to show them
3. Enter discount values as needed

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Time tracking**: Use date ranges for accurate time-based billing
- **Mixed billing**: Combine date-based items with fixed-quantity items in the same invoice
- **Template efficiency**: Save invoices with date ranges as templates for recurring work
- **Clean invoices**: Use "None" for discount type when discounts aren't applicable

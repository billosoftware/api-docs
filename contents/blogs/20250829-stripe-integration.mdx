## Stripe Integration

We wanted to make it easier for your customers to pay you. That's why we've partnered with Stripe, to allow you to get paid faster. If you're on a Starter or Professional plan, you can integrate your Stripe API key to allow us to create payment links on your behalf. We will then automatically embed this link into your invoice preview link, as well as the PDF invoice we create for you.

Your clients can then pay directly into your Stripe account, using their debit/credit cards, Apple Pay and Google Pay. Offering payment flexibility in your invoices allows your customers to pay you quicker, using a method that is convenient for them. No cash on hand, no worries! Pay with credit.

- Simple integration with Stripe
- Subscribe to Billo, add your Stripe API key, off you go!

## Status Monitoring

We know how important it is for you to ensure you get paid on time. That's why we've partnered with incident.io to provide you with ongoing real-time status updates on our service features. If anything goes wrong, you will be notified as soon as we have identified there's an issue. You can check the current status of Billo [here](https://status.billoinvoicing.com). Alternatively, you can view the page at https://status.billoinvoicing.com. We hope you'll never need to use it, but on the off chance that something does go wrong. You know where to find updates.

If this isn't something that works for you, you also have the option to follow us on socials. We're @billoinvoicing on everything!
